Job Finder Agent Setup Instructions
===================================

1. Create a file named ".env" in the project root directory

2. Add the following content to the .env file:

FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Optional: Enable verbose output (defaults to false)
# VERBOSE=true

3. Install dependencies:
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
   or
   pip install openai-agents python-dotenv rich

4. Run the agent:
   python main.py
   
   # Or with verbose logging:
   VERBOSE=true python main.py

The agent will:
- Ask you to describe the kind of job you're looking for
- Scrape Hacker News jobs page
- Find the most fitting job based on your description
- Present the job details to you 

Logging Modes:
- Default (quiet): Shows only agent responses and final results
- Verbose: Shows tool calls, connection status, and intermediate steps
